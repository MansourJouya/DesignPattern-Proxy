# Design Patterns - Proxy

This repository showcases an implementation of the Proxy design pattern in C#. The code demonstrates how a proxy can act as a placeholder to control access to an object, providing additional logic such as access control. This pattern is useful in scenarios where you need to add a layer of control over interactions with a real object, including lazy initialization, security checks, or logging.

## Introduction
The Proxy design pattern is a structural pattern that provides an object representing another object to control access to it. Proxies can be used to implement various additional behaviors, such as authentication, logging, and lazy initialization. By using a proxy, you can control and extend the operations of a real object without altering its code.

## Implementation Overview
This repository provides a C# implementation of the Proxy design pattern. Key components of the code include:

- **IRealSubject Interface**: Defines the common interface for both the `RealSubject` and the `Proxy`.
- **RealSubject Class**: Implements the actual work that the proxy controls access to.
- **Proxy Class**: Implements the `IRealSubject` interface and adds logic (e.g., access control) before delegating the request to the `RealSubject`.
- **Program Class**: Demonstrates how the proxy works, showing how access is managed and delegated.

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MansourJouya/DesignPattern-Proxy.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd DesignPattern-Proxy
```

Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred C# development environment to explore the implementation.

## Usage
1. Open the solution file (.sln) in your C# development environment.
2. Run the `Program` class to see the Proxy pattern in action.
3. Modify the `Proxy` and `RealSubject` classes to customize the access control logic or add new functionality.
